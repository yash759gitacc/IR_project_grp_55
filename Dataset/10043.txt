The tomb's design was influenced by Akbar's own eclectic tastes and religious beliefs, reflecting his efforts to create a syncretic Mughal culture that embraced diversity and pluralism. Akbar's Tomb served as a dynastic mausoleum for the Mughal emperors, with subsequent rulers, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, adding their own contributions to its architecture and decoration.
