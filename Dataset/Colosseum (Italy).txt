This iconic amphitheater has witnessed countless spectacles, gladiatorial combats, and historical events, cementing its place as one of the most iconic and well-preserved structures from antiquity.

**Historical Origins and Construction:**

The construction of the Colosseum, originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater, was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in 72 AD. It was completed during the reign of his son, Titus, in 80 AD, and inaugurated with a lavish 100-day festival featuring gladiatorial contests and exotic animal hunts.
