**Vatican City: A Tapestry of History, Culture, and Spirituality**

Nestled in the heart of Rome, Vatican City is an independent city-state renowned for its religious significance, historical grandeur, and artistic treasures. As the smallest country in the world, it encompasses just over 110 acres and is home to the Pope and the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.

**History**

The origins of Vatican City trace back to the 4th century AD when Emperor Constantine I donated the Lateran Palace to Pope Miltiades. This marked the beginning of the Vatican's association with the papacy. Over the centuries, the popes amassed temporal power and acquired additional territories, forming the Papal States.

In 1870, Italian troops annexed Rome, ending the temporal power of the pope. This led to a period of tension known as the "Roman Question." In 1929, the Lateran Treaty, negotiated between the Holy See and the Italian government, established Vatican City as an independent city-state.
