History
Commissioned by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE, Sanchi Stupa was originally a simple brick structure containing the relics of Buddha. Over the centuries, successive rulers and Buddhist communities made additions and renovations to the stupa complex, enriching its architectural and artistic legacy. The site fell into obscurity following the decline of Buddhism in India but was rediscovered and restored in the 19th century by British archaeologists. Since then, Sanchi Stupa has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has played a vital role in promoting Buddhist heritage and culture on a global scale.
