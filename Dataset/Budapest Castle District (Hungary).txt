**Budapest Castle District: A Historical and Cultural Haven**

Nestled atop Castle Hill on the west bank of the Danube River, Budapest's Castle District is a captivating tapestry of architectural splendor and historical significance. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this iconic neighborhood has witnessed centuries of Hungary's turbulent past and boasts an array of cultural and architectural treasures.

**Historical Evolution**

The origins of Budapest Castle District date back to the 13th century when King BÃ©la IV constructed a royal fortress upon Castle Hill following the Mongol invasion. Over the centuries, the castle underwent numerous expansions and modifications, evolving into a sprawling stronghold that served as the political and administrative center of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1541, the Ottoman Empire conquered Buda, and the Castle District fell under Turkish rule for over 150 years. This period left an indelible mark on the district's architecture, with many buildings incorporating elements of Ottoman design. After the Ottoman retreat in 1686, the Castle District was rebuilt in the Baroque style, giving it much of the elegance and grandeur it possesses today.
