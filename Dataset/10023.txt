Description
The Kanheri Caves are a group of rock-cut Buddhist caves located within the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Dating back to the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE, these ancient caves served as a major Buddhist monastic complex and center of learning. Carved into the basalt cliffs of the Western Ghats, the caves comprise viharas (monastic cells), chaityas (prayer halls), and stupas (domed structures). The interiors of the caves are adorned with exquisite sculptures, relief carvings, and inscriptions, depicting scenes from the life of Buddha, Buddhist deities, and mythological narratives.

They served as centers of Buddhist learning, meditation, and worship, attracting monks and pilgrims from across the Indian subcontinent. The caves also played a pivotal role in the transmission of Buddhist teachings and scriptures, contributing to the rich tapestry of Indian religious and cultural heritage. Today, the Kanheri Caves are a popular tourist destination and a pilgrimage site for Buddhists, offering visitors a glimpse into the spiritual and artistic legacy of ancient India.

History
The Kanheri Caves were excavated over several centuries, beginning around the 1st century BCE during the Hinayana phase of Buddhism and continuing through the Mahayana period until the 10th century CE. The caves flourished under the patronage of various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Kshatrapas, and Rashtrakutas. They served as thriving centers of Buddhist monasticism and scholarship, housing thousands of monks and scholars engaged in religious activities and intellectual pursuits. Over time, the caves fell into obscurity and were abandoned, only to be rediscovered in the 19th century by British archaeologists. Since then, the Kanheri Caves have been recognized as a valuable archaeological and cultural heritage site, preserving the legacy of ancient India's Buddhist civilization for future generations.
