History
Commissioned in 1921, India Gate was originally known as the All India War Memorial. It was constructed to honor the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Empire during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Connaught, representing King George V, and the memorial was unveiled by the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, in 1931. Over the years, India Gate has evolved into a symbol of national pride and solidarity, standing as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by generations past.
